# List vs Tuple vs Dictionary vs Set
list       	->	Ordered,   	Changable	      & Allow Duplicate items

tuple	      ->	Ordered,    not changable   & Allow Duplicate items

dictionary	->	Ordered, 	  changable	      & Not allow Duplicate items 
note: dictionaries are ordered means -> they retains insertion order from Python 3.7 onwards.
prior to Python3.7 they are unordered 
set 	      ->	Unordered, 	not changable	  & Not allow Duplicate items
